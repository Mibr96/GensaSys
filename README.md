# GensaSys ( WIP ) 
GensaSys is a work in progress windows application, which is going to be a dashboard for all sorts of sys-admin releated stuff. 
Right now, I just got the login screen finished ( With a working auth system ) 

I am just getting started on the main content of the system and it will take a while to finish.
